# The Un-Official archive of old the non-LVS version of Simfphys
 A backup of simfphys before the update because LVS fucking sucks!

## Sause?
- [Simphys - Base](https://github.com/Blu-x92/simfphys_base/tree/48af73c6b48a62275fe0f867ac7d5f8c2fcc4121)
- [Simfphys - Armed](https://github.com/Blu-x92/simfphys_armed/tree/577f5a760b6442fecb1b997ec15d3cae5500e559)
- I ripped the files from there and found an older commit from right before Blu ruined Simfphys. I'm simply putting it in this repo so that it can be easier to access in the future without having to jump through old commit histories.

**Note: I will NOT be providing updates to this code. this is an archive! if you want updates, fork this repo and make the changes on your own :3**

## Why tho?
I made this repository because I dislike the direction and code of LVS. I uploaded this because there is most likely breaking changes in the new LVS Cars fake physics addon, which would create issues with older addons which rely on Simfphys in it's standalone no-LVS state. Among other issues like the LVS controls feeling more sluggish and clunky than Blu's previous addons.
